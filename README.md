# War Room Game

### A strategic turn based story driven rogue-lite

Take control of a military campaign from your war room by making decisions on troop movements, fortifications, mobilisation and operations.

Gain intelligence from your commanders on the front lines, your state's advisors or even deploy a spy network to infiltrate your adversary's ranks. But be careful with what and specifically who you trust.

#### About

This is a hobby project I am developing in Godot 4. Its inspired by the decision gameplay of Reigns, story of FTL, map of Foxhole, resource management of Mini Metro and all wrapped in an alternate 1940's time period.

The gameplay is split into 3 days on a repeating cycle. One where you learn intel, another where an event occurs and the final day you make a decision such as deploying a spy network.

Each day you can also advance your troops, fortify positions and decide which troops to resupply. The success of these movements and the choices the enemy have made are only known to you the morning of the *next* day.

The current aim is to have the game completeable in short 20 minute sessions, by limiting the options you can achieve each day and having a limit of 100 days where a coalition force arrives for the enemy, similar to FTL.

There are no deadlines for this project as I am very busy studying for my masters and working a part time job. However I'm working towards a feature complete and playable MVP and will then take feedback, implement graphics, and write the story sections.
